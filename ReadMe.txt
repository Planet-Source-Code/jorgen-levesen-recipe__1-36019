Recipe

This program was made on behalf of my wife and is now in daily use at home. Also I have made this program available free of charge for all those of my colleagues who whish to use it. 

The program is straight forward to use, but there is a couple of  things to point out:

The program use the MS Outlook for sending email, but it detect if Outlook does not exist on the computer, and in such a case tries to send the mail via Internet

I am using an old VB5 component, DBGrid32.ocx, in the program. If you have not upgraded from VB5 and this component is missing you can find it in the “MissingFiles.zip”. Here you can also find MS Office  components as the Outlook 2000 type library (Msoutl9.olb) which is necessary when using the Outlook mail system.

The program is bi-lingual, it is delivered in English but if you wish you can change to whatever language you wish. To change to another language:

1.	Go to menu item Database/Language/New Language and click the country name you wish to change the language to. Click the OK-button.
2.	If  this new language is in the database, all form text will change accordingly and you do not have to read further on. 
3.	If this new language is not defined in the database all form text will be shown in English. You now have to manually translate all for-text and captions yourself.
4.	Go to menu item Database/Language/Screen Text. In the Screen-Text-Form which now will appear, you can freely change all text strings defined. Each defined language has its own line in the recordset. Fx English have a line start with ENG, Norwegian have a line starting with NOR etc.

I thank all who have contributed with code for this program. I have tried to give due respect in the frmAbout but have not always got the programmers name. If you find a piece of YOUR code in the program, please email me at Jorgen@levesen.com, and I will rectify this error.

This source code is yours for the keeping and you can freely change whatever you wish. I would though appreciate a mail telling me what could be done better.

Bon appetite
