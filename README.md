### Description

This is just a relative simple database program for storing of food recipe's. I have included approximately 1050 recipe's with the source code, unfortunately I had to remove all the recipe pictures, as I got a 25 MB database with pictures.

This source code is yours for the keeping, and you are free to use it as you wish.

Please do not bother to vote - but I would very much appreciate any feedback.

Have a nice day.
